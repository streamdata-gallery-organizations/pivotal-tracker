description: Writing software isn&rsquo;t half as hard as all the talking, emails,
  and meetings needed to reconcile shifting requirements and slipping deadlines. We
  get it, we&rsquo;ve been there. In fact, we&rsquo;re still there. Were Pivotal Labs,
  a web and mobile development consultancy. In 2006 we built Tracker for our developers
  and clients to facilitate constructive communication, reflect the status of a project
  and help forecast its future. Today Tracker is a staple of the developers toolkit.
